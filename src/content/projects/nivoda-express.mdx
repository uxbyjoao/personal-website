## Introduction

**Nivoda Express** is an innovation by Nivoda for premium diamond shipping. The goal of the project is to obtain a competitive advantage in the diamonds e-commerce space by offering industry-leading shipping times for end customers in North America and Europe, while also opening up business opportunities for diamond suppliers in India. Nivoda Express was launched in early 2023 the United Kingdom as a pilot, and is currently live with a sell-through rate of around 20%.

## My roles

Research, low & high-fidelity prototyping, user testing, handover.

## The problem

Delivering diamonds for end customers in Europe and North America currently means dealing with long shipping times. End customers — local diamond dealers — in these regions usually have to wait between **7 to 10 business days** for their purchases in traditional marketplaces to reach them — sometimes more.

## Proposed solution

Use data mining, advanced algorithms and industry knowledge to predict sales in these regions, and ship stones to local Nivoda fulfilment centres in advance. With this approach, Nivoda can drastically cut down delivery times to end customers. The initial proposed goal is 1 to 2 business days, but even same-day shipping is possible.

## The challenge

Currently, there is no off-the-shelf inventory and shipment management solution that supports the idiosyncrasies of the diamond industry. Suppliers have a traditional way of working, so there is a trust barrier that needs to be overcome. Also, shipping high-value items like diamonds in bulk means dealing with customs clearance, insurance and shipping companies, etc. Therefore, the solution was to build such a system in-house.

It was decided early on that, in order to automate as much as possible, RFID-scanning boards developed by a company called SpaceCode would be used, so the system would have to be build with the SpaceCode board's technical constrains in mind. The boards read RFID tags in bulk and are IoT-enabled so that they can send scanning data to the cloud, so the plan was to use the boards for shipment creation and integrity checking, as well as on-site inventory control.

## Research

Initially, **expert interviews** were conducted to construct the context of use. After that, **task analysis** and **customer journey maps** were employed to properly model the user journeys and system responses. **Low-fidelity wireframes** were used to sketch the general flows.
